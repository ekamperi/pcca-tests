POSSIBLE PLACES OF CONFUSION

* The user that runs the test must NOT be root. This is a good practice anyway,
but it's not just that. Some tests require that they are executed in a non-
privileged context, eg. unistd.h/t_access2.
On the other hand, the user MUST belong to the sudoers, because in some places,
we need to set-user_ID bit or change the owner of a file, eg. unistd.t_access2.
XXX: What about Solaris 10 and later?


* In Linux particularly, but in other systems as well, make sure that you don't
mount the medium where the tests reside as 'nosuid' (or similar). Again, this is
because some tests have the set-user-ID bit set, eg. unistd.h/t_access2. Running
them in a context where the uid can't be escalated, it will result in a false
failed test.
If you want to get the list of suid binaries in the repository, after you have
built the tests, type:

~/git-repos/pcca-tests% find . -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -exec \
> ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root  beket   6.9K Aug 12 00:09 ./unistd.h/t_access2
~/git-repos/pcca-tests%


* If you try to grep(1) recursively inside a $header.h directory that contains
a sandbox/ directory, grep may block indefinitely in 'fifoor' state or similar.
This is due to presence of a fifo special file inside the sandbox/ directory,
which will block grep upon opening it. This is perfectly legitimate behavior and
not some bug of grep. It can be circumvented by passing -O option to grep, to
skip special files. -O though is non-standard so it may not be readily available
to all systems systems. In such case, just delete the sandboxes/ with:

~/git-repos/pcca-tests% ./mktests.sh -c
~/git-repos/pcca-tests%

and then grep.
