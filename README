CAVEATS

* The user that runs the test must not be root. This is a good practice anyway,
but furthermore some tests require that they run as non-privileged users,
eg. unistd.h/t_access2.

On the other hand, the user must belong to the sudoers, because in some places,
we need to set-user_ID bit or change the owner of a file, eg. unistd.t_access2.

XXX: What about Solaris 10 and later?


* In Linux particularly, but in other systems as well, make sure that you don't
mount the medium where the tests reside as 'nosuid' (or similar). 

Some test cases have the set-user-ID bit set, eg. unistd.h/t_access2.
