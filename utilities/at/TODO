* Print job dates upon job submission.
  http://bugs.dragonflybsd.org/issue1432
* Default queue is 'c', although it should be 'a'. Solaris gets it right.
* Every job should either be submitted for today or tomorrow, if no date is
  given. So "at: trying to travel back in time" should never be printed.
  Solaris gets it right.
