Q: Why did you choose BSD license ? Some tests look rather trivial to the point
   that a public domain license would fit better.
A: The first tests were developed as part of the Google Summer of Code project
   and they had to be licensed under some free license listed in here:
   http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical . Unfortunately, public
   domain, which has been my initial intention, isn't. A 2-clause BSD license
   appeared to me as the next best choice. After the end of the project, I
   didn't bother changing it, for reasons of uniformity.


Q: Why some test cases run slow eventhough my machine is very fast ?
A: There are test cases that call sleep(...) in order to ensure that
   certain time conditions are met. These conditions are paramount to
   the proper execution of the test cases themselves and cannot be
   circumvented.
