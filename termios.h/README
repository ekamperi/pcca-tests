Currently we are relying on our program being invoked by a terminal.
Had we wanted to be more robust, we would instead allocate a pseudo
terminal with open + ptsname + grantpt + unlockpt.

We don't because the code complexity would increase significantly.
Moreover,  it is said that ptsname + granpt + unlockpt have inherent
design flaws that make them insecure. So, for instance, OpenBSD doesn't
implement them at all.
